- config exposes PARQUET_CACHE_PATH for unified cache location.
- data_loader.load_dataset loads the Parquet and rebuilds when missing.
- cli.py now accepts --rebuild-cache to trigger cache build before running.
- FileLock prevents simultaneous writes.
- Dockerfile and CI workflow install filelock package.
- Small sample raw CSVs placed under veri/ham for tests.
- cache_build_log.txt records first build and cache-hit runs.
