- Added cache_builder module to assemble CSV files into a single Parquet.
- config exposes PARQUET_CACHE_PATH for unified cache location.
- data_loader.load_dataset loads the Parquet and rebuilds when missing.
- cli.py now accepts --rebuild-cache to trigger cache build before running.
- FileLock prevents simultaneous writes.
- Dockerfile and CI workflow install filelock package.
- Small sample raw CSVs placed under veri/ham for tests.
- cache_build_log.txt records first build and cache-hit runs.
- New test ensures cache rebuild creates non-empty Parquet.
- All unit tests run successfully after changes.
- Added cycle detection and depth guard for filter trees.
- New MAX_FILTER_DEPTH default is 15.
- filter_engine.evaluate_filter now raises CyclicFilterError and MaxDepthError.
- Validation helper moved to `filtre_dogrulama.validate`.
- cli.py gains --validate-filters option to verify definitions only.
- New unit tests cover cycle and depth errors.
- cycle_test_log.txt captures test run output.
- Validation exits with status 2 when cycles are present.
- Placeholder apply_filter_logic returns filter id for now.
- Two cycles detected in synthetic tests during development.
- Consolidated configuration into paket `finansal_analiz_sistemi.config`.
- Renamed old root config to `config_local.py` to prevent shadowing.
- Added `config_resolver.py` for runtime detection and log level control.
- Updated imports to require explicit package config usage.
- Packaging now installs only `finansal_analiz_sistemi`.
- `APP_ENV` environment toggles logging level via resolver.
- Dockerfile sets `APP_ENV=prod` by default.
- CI workflow tests both dev and prod environments.
- Coverage artefacts now include env and Python version in the filename to
  prevent name conflicts.
- New unit test verifies shadow config detection.
- `flake8-bugbear` added; mutable default ignored with `# noqa: B006`.
- `packages` list in setup.cfg uses newline form to avoid install error.
- Config maps `ITS_9` aliases to `ichimoku_conversionline` and calculator computes it when requested.
- Added automatic EMA/close crossover generator and config loader.
- Config defaults now include classic pivot column and crossovers.
- indicator_calculator.add_crossovers parses names via regex.
- config_loader.load_crossover_names collects all crossover names.
- New tests cover crossover generation and logging.
