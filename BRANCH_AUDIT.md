# Branch Audit

As of 2025-07-09 the repository briefly contained two local branches, `main` and `work`, both at the same commit. No remotes were configured.
The stray `work` branch was removed and a follow-up check on 2025-07-09 confirmed that `main` is now the sole branch. No divergences or conflicts were found.
