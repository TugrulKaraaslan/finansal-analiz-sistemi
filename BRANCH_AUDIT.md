# Branch Audit

As of 2025-07-09 the repository briefly contained two local branches, `main` and `work`, both at the same commit. No remotes were configured. The stray `work` branch was removed and a follow-up check confirmed that `main` is now the sole branch with no divergences or conflicts.

Verification on 2025-07-09 reconfirmed that `main` was the only branch. A later check on 2025-07-23 again found the `work` branch present. It was removed so that only `main` remains.
