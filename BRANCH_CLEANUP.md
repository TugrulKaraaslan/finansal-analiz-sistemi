# Branch Cleanup

Removed redundant `work` branch which duplicated `main`.
After the cleanup, only the `main` branch remains. The repository was checked again to ensure no additional branches are present.
Rechecked as of 2025: 'work' has been fully deleted.
Reconfirmed: only 'main' exists.
Revalidated on 2025-07-09 after remote fetch: only 'main' branch remains.
