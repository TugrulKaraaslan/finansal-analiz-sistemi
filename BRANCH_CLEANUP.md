# Branch Cleanup

The redundant local branch `work` duplicated `main` and has been deleted. After cleanup the repository only contains the `main` branch.

Verification on 2025-07-09 confirms that `main` is the sole branch and there are no additional local or remote branches. A second review on the same date reconfirmed the cleanup.
